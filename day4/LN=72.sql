-- Schema Airport

-- The database schema consists of 4 tables:
-- Company(ID_comp, name)
-- Trip(trip_no, id_comp, plane, town_from, town_to, time_out, time_in)
-- Passenger(ID_psg, name)
-- Pass_in_trip(trip_no, date, ID_psg, place)
--The Company table contains IDs and names of the airlines transporting passengers. The Trip table contains information on the schedule of flights: trip (flight) number, company (airline) ID, plane type, departure city, destination city, departure time, and arrival time. The Passenger table holds IDs and names of the passengers. The Pass_in_trip table contains data on flight bookings: trip number, departure date (day), passenger ID and her seat (place) designation during the flight. It should be noted that
-- * scheduled flights are operated daily; the duration of any flight is -- less than 24 hours; town_from <> town_to;
-- * all time and date values are assumed to belong to the same time zone;
-- * departure and arrival times are specified with one minute precision;
-- * there can be several passengers bearing the same first name and surname (for example, Bruce Willis);
-- * the seat (place) designation consists of a number followed by a letter; the number stands for the row, while the letter (a � d) defines the seat position in the grid (from left to right, in alphabetical order;
-- * connections and constraints are shown in the database schema below.


-- Problem
-- Among the customers using a single airline, find distinct passengers who have flown most frequently. Result set: passenger name, number of trips.

SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES
  sq.name,
  sq.trip_n FROM
(
SELECT p.name as name, COUNT(pt .trip_no) as trip_n
FROM Passenger p
INNER JOIN pass_in_trip pt ON pt .id_psg = p.id_psg
INNER JOIN trip t ON pt .trip_no = t.trip_no
GROUP BY p.name
) as sq
ORDER By sq.trip_n DESC
